The restriction, in 2020, of the ""Ugly"" bundled tariff to young people up to the age of 23 (Regulator's decision) and its subsequent discontinuation in 2022 (operator's decision), which would have gradually led to a decrease in the duplication of OPMS SIM cards in its customer base, consequently reducing the number of active subscribers. 2. A significant emigration of the young population has occurred over the past two years. 3.
