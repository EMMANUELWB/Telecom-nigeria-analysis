# Telecom Data Analytics Case Study: Nigeria

This project provides an end-to-end analysis of the Nigerian telecommunications sector using open data sources. The focus is on exploring market competition, infrastructure development, and broadband penetration, with the goal of uncovering insights that demonstrate practical use of Excel, SQL, R, and Tableau in a real-world context.

## Project Goal
To analyze growth trends and competition within Nigeria’s telecom industry and to evaluate how operator market share and broadband penetration are connected to infrastructure expansion, such as the rollout of cell towers.

## Datasets
- Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC): industry statistics including mobile subscriptions, broadband penetration, and operator market share.  
- OpenCelliD: cell tower location data for Nigeria.  
- World Bank / ITU: mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people for normalization and comparison.  

## Scope of Work
1. **Data Preparation** – cleaning and organizing raw datasets using Excel.  
2. **Data Modeling** – building relational structures and running queries in SQL.  
3. **Statistical Analysis** – applying R for correlation analysis, growth trends, and forecasting.  
4. **Visualization** – creating dashboards and interactive visuals in Tableau.  

## Expected Outcomes
- Market share trends among MTN, Airtel, Glo, and 9mobile over time.  
- The relationship between infrastructure growth (cell towers) and customer adoption.  
- Broadband penetration trends with projections for future growth.  

## Tools
Excel · SQL · R · Tableau
