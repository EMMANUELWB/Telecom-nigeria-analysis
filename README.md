# 📡 Telecom Data Analytics Case Study: Nigeria  

## Project Overview  
This project explores Nigeria’s mobile industry using data from the **Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)** and the **World Bank (WB)**. It highlights how mobile subscriptions and teledensity expanded rapidly from 2000, and the sudden reversal that began after 2021.  

## Goal  
- Convert World Bank’s *“mobile subscriptions per 100 people”* into total subscriptions using Nigeria’s population.  
- Merge World Bank totals with NCC’s annual December subscription figures.  
- Compare differences between NCC and WB reporting.  
- Track teledensity alongside subscription growth.  
- Communicate insights through visualizations and storytelling.  

## Datasets  
- **Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC):** Monthly subscriptions and teledensity  
- **World Bank (WB):** Mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people  
- **World Bank (Population):** Annual Nigerian population estimates  

## Methodology  
- **R (dplyr, readr, ggplot2):** Data cleaning, merging, visualization  
- **PowerPoint:** Storytelling of insights and trends  
- **Gamma / AI:** Assisted presentation design and refinement  

## Key Insights  
- Subscriptions grew from almost zero in 2000 to over 200 million by the early 2020s  
- World Bank and NCC totals align closely once converted to the same scale  
- Subscriptions and teledensity rose steadily until 2021, then dropped sharply after 2022  
- By 2023, subscriptions fell back to about 220 million, with teledensity also declining  
- The downturn aligns with the **NIN–SIM linkage directive**, which deactivated unregistered lines  
- Charts and the **impact results table** in this repo show how sudden and disruptive the shift was
