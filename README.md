# ðŸ“¡ Telecom Data Analytics Case Study: Nigeria

## Project Overview
This project explores the Nigerian telecom industry by analyzing market growth, competition, and infrastructure. It highlights how operator market share and broadband penetration are linked to infrastructure development, particularly cell towers. The case study demonstrates end-to-end analysis using Excel, SQL, R, and Tableau.

## Goal
Provide insights into the performance of Nigeriaâ€™s major telecom operators (MTN, Airtel, Glo, 9mobile), track broadband penetration trends, and examine how infrastructure growth supports customer adoption.

## Datasets
- **Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC):** Market statistics (subscriptions, penetration, operator share).  
- **OpenCelliD:** Tower location data across Nigeria.  
- **World Bank / ITU:** Global telecom benchmarks for comparison.  

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation (Excel):** Import and clean raw datasets, handle duplicates, and standardize formats.  
2. **Data Modeling (SQL):** Build relational schema, create calculated fields, and run queries on adoption and market share.  
3. **Analysis (R):** Perform trend analysis, statistical comparisons, and forecasting.  
4. **Visualization (Tableau):** Build dashboards to communicate findings through KPIs, charts, and geospatial insights.  

## Expected Insights
- Market share changes among major operators.  
- Relationship between tower deployment and broadband adoption.  
- Forecast of broadband penetration growth in Nigeria.  

## Next Steps
- Extend analysis with geospatial tower density maps.  
- Compare Nigeriaâ€™s performance with peer African markets.  
- Automate periodic data updates with scripts.
