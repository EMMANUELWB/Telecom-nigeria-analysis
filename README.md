# üì° Telecom Data Analytics Case Study: Nigeria

## Project Overview
This project explores the growth of Nigeria‚Äôs mobile industry by reconciling data from the **Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)** and the **World Bank (WB)**. The analysis focuses on mobile subscription totals and teledensity trends, providing a snapshot of market expansion and saturation over time.

## Goal
- Convert World Bank‚Äôs *‚Äúmobile subscriptions per 100 people‚Äù* into total subscriptions using Nigeria‚Äôs population.  
- Merge World Bank totals with NCC‚Äôs annual (December) subscription figures.  
- Compare reporting differences between NCC and WB.  
- Track **teledensity trends** alongside subscription growth.  
- Communicate insights through clear visualizations and storytelling.

## Datasets
- **Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC):** Monthly mobile subscriptions & teledensity.  
- **World Bank (WB):** Mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people.  
- **World Bank (Population):** Annual Nigerian population estimates.  

## Methodology
- **R (dplyr, readr, ggplot2):** Data cleaning, merging, and visualization.  
- **PowerPoint:** Storytelling of insights and trends.  

## Key Insights
- Both NCC and World Bank datasets confirm strong growth in Nigeria‚Äôs mobile subscriptions since 2000.  
- After conversion, WB and NCC totals align closely, with small gaps due to reporting methods.  
- **Teledensity** rose steadily with subscriptions but shows recent plateauing, reflecting market maturity and near-saturation levels.  
- By 2023, Nigeria recorded over **220 million subscriptions**, exceeding population size and highlighting widespread mobile adoption.
